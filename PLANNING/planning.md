 ## The Plan
 This is going to be an outer space social community site:
 - users can create groups on various topics(SpaceX, NASA, Pluto, etc...)
 - The can then creat posts in the groups.
 - They can also leave and join other groups
 
 The key features will be:
    - Groups(similar to subreddits)
    - Multiple Users and Authorizations
    - Post in groups (similar to a tweet)
    - Linking user profiles with @ symbol
